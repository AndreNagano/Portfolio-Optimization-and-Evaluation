# Portfolio Optimization + Evaluation

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook with a study about optimizing a investment portfolio and a method for evaluating its performance.

## Portfolio Optimization

The first part has a introduction to Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) explaining certain concepts, like the efficient frontier and capital market line. Then, there is an example on building a portfolio by minimizing the negative Sharpe ratio.

## Portfolio Evaluation (Monte Carlo)

The second part details the Monte Carlo Method for evaluating a portfolio's risk and return. We first model the movements of stock prices with a Multidimensional Geometric Brownian Motion (M-GBM) and then simulate the portfolio multiple times to get a grasp of the portfolio's characteristcs.
